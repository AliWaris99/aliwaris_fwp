<h3>Introduction</h3><br>
<p class="bb1">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment<br> (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
<br>
<p class="bb1">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as<br> operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it<br> with additional objects; for example</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li class="bb2">
        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
    </li><br>

    <li class="bb2">
        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
    </li><br>
</ul>

<h3>
    What you should already know
</h3><br>
<p class="bb1">
    This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
</p><br>

<li class="bb2">A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
<li class="bb2">Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
<li class="bb2">Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
<br> 
<h3>JavaScript and Java</h3><br>
<p class="bb1">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type</p>
<br>
<p class="bb1">checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
<br>
<p class="bb1">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
<br>
<h3>Hello world</h3><br>

<p class="bb1">To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
<br>
<p class="b1">function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");</p>
<br>
<p class="bb1">Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
<br>
<h3>Variables</h3><br>

<p class="bb1">You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
<br>
<p class="b1">A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
<br>
<p class="bb1">You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
<br>
<h3>Declaring variables</h3><br>

<p class="bb1">You can declare a variable in three ways:</p><br>
<p class="bb1">With the keyword var. For example,</p>
<br><br>
<p>var x = 42.</p>

<p class="bb1">This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p><br>

<p class="bb1">By simply assigning it a value. For example,<br><br>

    let y = 13.</p>

 <p class="bb1">This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>   
 <br>
 <h3>Variable scope</h3><br>

 <p class="bb1">When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
 <br>
 <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
<br>
<p class="b1">if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</p>
<br>
<p class="bb1">This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
<br>
<p class="b1">if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not<br><br>

    Defined</p><br>

 <h3>Global variables</h3>  <br> 

 <p class="bb1">Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
 <br>
 <p class="bb1">Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
 <br>
<h3>Constants</h3><br>
<p class="bb1">You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
<br>
<p class="b1">const PI = 3.14;</p>
<br>
<p class="bb1">A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
<br>
<p class="bb1">The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
<br>
<p class="bb1">You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
<br>
<p class="b1">// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements }</p>
<br>
<p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
<br>
<p class="b1">const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</p><br>
